The UPDATE statement is used to modify the existing records in a table.
Update command syntax: UPDATE table_name SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ... WHERE condition;
Example: update book set title="DBMS" where book_id=1;

The ORDER BY keyword sorts the records in ascending order by default. To sort the records in descending order, use the DESC keyword.
Syntax: SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name ORDER BY column1, column2, ... ASC|DESC;
Example: SELECT * FROM Customers ORDER BY Country;

The DELETE statement is used to delete existing records in a table.
Syntax: DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;
Example: DELETE FROM Customers WHERE CustomerName='Alfreds Futterkiste';

The LIKE operator is used in a WHERE clause to search for a specified pattern in a column.
There are two wildcards often used in conjunction with the LIKE operator:
    The percent sign (%) represents zero, one, or multiple characters
     The underscore sign (_) represents one, single character
     Syntax: SELECT column1, column2, ...FROM table_name WHERE columnN LIKE pattern;
     Example: SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'a%';
     
The WHERE clause is used to filter records.
Sytax: SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name WHERE condition;
Example: SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE Country='Mexico'

The SQL AND, OR and NOT Operators
The WHERE clause can be combined with AND, OR, and NOT operators.
The AND and OR operators are used to filter records based on more than one condition:
The AND operator displays a record if all the conditions separated by AND are TRUE.
The OR operator displays a record if any of the conditions separated by OR is TRUE.
The NOT operator displays a record if the condition(s) is NOT TRUE.
And Syntax: SELECT column1, column2, ...FROM table_name WHERE condition1 AND condition2 AND condition3 ...;
OR Syntax: SELECT column1, column2, ...FROM table_name WHERE condition1 OR condition2 OR condition3 ...;
Not Syntax: SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name WHERE NOT condition;
Example: SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE Country='Germany' AND City='Berlin';
Example: SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE City='Berlin' OR City='MÃ¼nchen';
Example: SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE Country='Germany' OR Country='Spain';
Example: SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE NOT Country='Germany';
