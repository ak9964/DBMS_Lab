The UPDATE statement is used to modify the existing records in a table.
Update command syntax: UPDATE table_name SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ... WHERE condition;
Example: update book set title="DBMS" where book_id=1;

The ORDER BY keyword sorts the records in ascending order by default. To sort the records in descending order, use the DESC keyword.
Syntax: SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name ORDER BY column1, column2, ... ASC|DESC;
Example: SELECT * FROM Customers ORDER BY Country;

The DELETE statement is used to delete existing records in a table.
Syntax: DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;
Example: DELETE FROM Customers WHERE CustomerName='Alfreds Futterkiste';

The LIKE operator is used in a WHERE clause to search for a specified pattern in a column.
There are two wildcards often used in conjunction with the LIKE operator:
    The percent sign (%) represents zero, one, or multiple characters
     The underscore sign (_) represents one, single character
     Syntax: SELECT column1, column2, ...FROM table_name WHERE columnN LIKE pattern;
     Example: SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'a%';
     
The WHERE clause is used to filter records.
Sytax: SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name WHERE condition;
Example: SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE Country='Mexico'
